# Participation in this project
you can review this code and come up with suggestions for improvement, 
report bugs or suggest design ideas. You have to submit a pr which I will
review and accept in case it is good and aligns with the project. 

In order for your pr to be reviewed and accepted please make sure to:
1. keep it reasonable in size. don't change a lot in one pr.
2. write a good description explaining what you did in this pr.
3. divide the pr into readable commits.

Those are best practices you should already follow anywhere you collaborate
on writing code.

Also, please make sure to follow clean code principles and conventions I mention
in my videos. I encourage you to participate as you will learn a a lot following
along in this project.
